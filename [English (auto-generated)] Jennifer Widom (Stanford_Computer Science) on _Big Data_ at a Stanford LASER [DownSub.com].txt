uncommon is a soccer ball soccer or the

loss of the creature has been my talk

okay big data big discoveries big

fallacies let's start by answering the

question what is big data anyway what

does it mean I'm sure all of you

occurred it probably too much I'm going

to give you a quick definition big data

is the process of collecting large

amounts of data and then actually doing

something with it so where is that data

coming from let me try to revise this

where is that data coming from could be

coming from computers that's one of the

most common things that could be coming

from sensors embedded in various places

it could be coming from people and what

does it mean to do something with that

data well we might use it to make

decisions we might use it to make

predictions we might have a hypothesis

we want to confirm and we need data to

do that or we might just want to gain

some insight from the data now you've

probably also heard the term data

science and none of these definitions

are perfect but i'm going to say that

data science is the science of going

from 1 to 2 of going from the collected

data to some insight some confirmation

of hypothesis something you're doing

with the data somebody recently asked me

the question is Big Data of bad and my

answer to that is well 30 years ago was

computer programming a fad people might

have thought so at the time I would

argue that it wasn't at the time and

that's proven itself out I would say

that the ability to collect data is only

going to increase over time I don't see

that slowing down and the ability to

analyze that data will only improve so I

don't see that anything is going to go

away and that's my argument that this is

not a bad okay so what am I going to do

in this talk I promise discoveries

fallacies and so on what I'm going to

start is with a few success stories of

big data things I hope that you can

relate to relatively quick just go

through some examples I think you'll all

be able to generate more examples for

yourself

everyday experience to spend the

reasonable amount of time on the

pitfalls it's going to get slightly

technical but I think most of you will

probably be able to follow most of it

and then if there's time I have one last

slide that is just about some techniques

and tools and this is just sort of to

demystify terminology and then use these

at your next cocktail party law firm

okay so here's my first big data success

story and this is traffic so most of you

probably use Google Maps or something

similar when you want to find out what

this happening with the tripod you pull

it up and you see the red is where the

traffic is stopped yellow is where it's

you know partially stopped and green is

where things are good everybody know

where that data is coming from how it's

been collected being collected from your

smartphones so there are not sensors in

the streets telling you how far those

that how fast the cars are moving then

you use your phone you have agreed to

transmit your location and there are

enough cars going around transmitting

their location on a you know

second-by-second basis to determine how

fast those cars are moving and that's

where that data is coming from so here

books oh you told me not to press that

button no matter what you do no press

on my clicker that's one ok let's

Hanuman all right here we go anyway this

is an example where data is being

collected in this case has been

collected but from everybody smartphones

and it's a lot of data and we're doing

something with other people are doing

something with it which is to make these

maps that are generally used for useful

for people alright another example that

you're probably very familiar with is

recommendation systems so Amazon will

tell you what they think you ought to

buy Netflix will tell you what movies

that you want you ought to be watching

how do they do this they do this by

collecting a huge amount of data so they

not only collect what everybody buys

they also collect what they don't buy

what they look at and don't buy what

they buy together what movies they watch

how they rate the movies you know what

movies are rated together and as much as

possible as much information about those

people as they can get their hands on

gender age where they live and so forth

and all that is put together such as

some pretty sophisticated algorithms

that tell you what they think you're

going to let you may not agree with them

but that's what they're doing so again

collecting a lot of data about

everybody's buying or watching patterns

and about their personal information and

then doing something with it which is

recommendation and by the way you will

as you can imagine advertising follows a

generally similar pattern which is

slightly more distasteful okay third

example for any sports fans out there so

I'm not heavily familiar with sports but

I have student in my freshman class was

very interested in sports data and he

uncovered the following apparently in

basketball all of the games are videoed

every detail of the games and then they

are computer analyzed to generate

statistics so in baseball for example

you know their statistics is very

straightforward than people are just

writing down and hit them all and you

got to this base but in basketball it's

a little more subtle dating the computer

analyzes the video and in what this one

particular example they found that this

one player kobe bryant where he is

on the occasions that he took this one

shot when his team had the ball the

pull-up jumper going to his left hand on

those occasions the possession of their

team converted to on average 0.1 points

less than they got over all the times

they edible so if they the opposing team

could force Kobe Bryant to the pull-up

jumper going left hand then that brings

down the expected score of that team and

apparently this the point one point over

a single game over a whole season is

very significant and so this was

something that was actually used this

cartoon here is a little bit related to

that here's my soccer ball it's not huge

but this cartoon says remember the other

team is counting on big data insights

based on previous games so kick the ball

with your other foot so this is another

example and this is having all over

sports like baseball again we know those

statistics have been around for a long

time people know Moneyball but in sports

like basketball it's generally video

hockey also and it's going on all over

the place collecting everything they can

about the games and then doing something

with it which is you know trying to

figure out their strategy for the next

game okay took a couple more examples I

picked this one partly because well two

reasons one is this example comes from

right where we're standing the Stanford

Medical School and the second because

this project was around way before big

data was popular this is a project done

by Russell and a faculty member here

where he's been collecting over I think

it's better maybe almost a couple

decades now information about the

relationship between human genetic

variation and drug responses and he's

just collected this information and

curated it and put it in a big database

for other researchers to use and I

wanted to point this out also because in

this case and this is a pretty common

one in science he's not actually

collecting the data and necessarily

himself doing something with it he's

collecting the data he's curating that

data and he's making it available for

others and by the way curating data it's

a sort of catch-all term for making sure

the data is clean and consistent and

usable and most people who embark on a

Big Data project will find that they

spend ninety percent of their time

getting their data curated and cleaned

up and ready and ten percent of their

time doing the actual analysis again I

taught a freshman seminar where the

Alden projects and they were just

floored by that ratio there another

example sort of along the same lines is

ocean health so at this point there are

about 44,000 some sensors out there in

the ocean that are generating all kinds

of measurements their physical about the

waves their chemical their biological

and that is they're all being assembled

put together and made available for

scientists to use another example of

gathering data curating data but then

putting it out there okay so that's

going to be the end of my success

stories but again I don't think many of

you will have any difficulty thinking of

your own so now I'm going to get into

the pitfalls and I'm going to zoom

through quite a few of them correlation

causation underfitting overfitting

sampling bias privacy and then I have a

couple that don't fall in a category and

they happen to both kick out in Google a

little bit I hope all the time to get to

them I know I'm moving fast but also be

available afterwards okay correlation

and causation are two things that are

often mixed up people frequently like to

say correlation does not imply causation

and so people often mix us two things up

let me try to explain them for you

correlation and causation are talking

about relationships between data values

so correlation says we've got two values

that tend to track each other they go up

together they go down together causation

says one value influences another

value and I'm just going to give you

some examples so for correlation height

and shoe size are correlated people who

are taller to have bigger feet smaller

smaller fee grades and test scores tend

to be correlated people with high grades

often at high test scores and vice versa

okay causation is an example where one

thing actually directly influences the

other for example education level baby

used to set someone's salary there's a

causation their temperature if it's

warmer people might buy ice cream the

important thing to know is that neither

one of these implies the other so in

correlation the two examples I gave it's

not that the height is causing your

choose to be bigger or the grades are

causing your test scores to be higher

okay and even in causation although

education level may influence salary you

can have your salary go up without

having a higher education level or

people there might be a spike in ice

cream sales even on a cold day so

there's not correlation there there's

causation here's another favorite

cartoon of mine this one is really old

actually and this child is flying on the

airplane because mother and says I wish

they didn't turn on that seatbelt sign

so much every time they do it gets bumpy

so this is an example this is an example

actually of causation but he's got the

causation in the wrong direction they're

a little bit more about causation and

correlation frequently but not always

when two things are correlated is

because there's this hidden thing called

a confounding variable that has

causation to both of the correlated

values so if you have you might have a

situation where a and B are correlated

because there's a hidden see that

implies both a and B and I'll just give

you an example we might have the fact

that the homeless population and the

crime rate in an area are correlated

when homeless population and try might

go up together they go

together it's not because the homeless

people are committing crimes and it's

not because crime is causing people to

be homeless so there's no direct

correlate causation but there is a

hidden causation of this count founding

variable in this case where there might

be which is unemployment which itself

causes populations that have homeless

and the crime rate and when unemployment

goes up those other two things go up

together now there's often there's also

cases where things appear correlated but

there is no causation and in fact they

don't cause each other at all and that's

really the problem that can come up and

data analysis and there's a few

entertaining ones i'm going to give you

for example let me show you let me just

explain this graph i'm going to show you

photographs that look kind of similar

we've got a timeline here from 2002 2009

and the red line is plotting the total

revenue generated by our caves okay over

that period there's the scale the black

line is computer science doctorates

awarded in the US and that's the that's

the scale over here and we can see

remarkably those two things track very

nicely um I don't think there's any

causation involved there at all not even

a hidden confounding variable I'm pretty

sure similar behavior drivers killed by

collision with a railway train and US

crude oil imports from Norway closely

correlated I can go on and on letters in

the winning word of the Scripps National

Spelling Bee is correlated very close to

the people killed by spiders and the age

of Miss America remarkably correlated

with people who are murdered by steam

hot vapor or hot objects okay so these

are all very interesting actually these

all have from a website or a service

that has gathered thousands maybe tens

of thousands of these graphs of these

trends and you can go on there and you

can just pick one and say tell me what's

correlated with this one because there's

so many of them it's pretty easy to find

of things that have nothing to do with

each other that show similar curve so

it's kind of fun you can find this all

over the web now people haven't had a

great time playing with that website

okay done with causation and correlation

now let's talk about underfitting and

overfitting which is another problem

that mistake that people can make in

data analysis underfitting is drawing

conclusions from data that are

effectively too simplistic and my

explanation is a little x let's get to

it I think you get the idea okay so as

background I'm going to briefly explain

to you the idea of regression regression

basically says I have some data points

and I'm going to try to extract a trend

from those data points that's the

high-level idea of what regression is

about so here's an example where we have

a graph of people's heights and weights

and I couldn't figure out what this

scale is but anyway it's a graph of P

this is a set of people in the

population and each data point

represents someone's height and weight

for example this is 60 and 80 okay and

when we gather all this data and then

there's an algorithm for drawing a line

that's called a linear regression

through those data points and why can

use that line for is to predict the

height or weight of someone else so

after you've taken the sample of the

data you draw the line or someone comes

along with you know height of 53 then

you would go right up to this point the

line 7 and predict that's their weight

okay that's what linear regression does

another example here is we have high

school GPA and we have university GPA

and you can see there's some you know

trend there you draw the line and that

would tell you okay if someone comes

along with a 3.12 GPA i'm just going to

go up to the line of predictor you can

go the other way to you can predict what

their high school GPA was from the

university or their how you from their

weight okay now there is an algorithm to

draw the best line for the point so you

get a set of points and there is a way

to draw the line basic

it adds up to go now what do i do not

that ok I'm giving away my thing here ok

there is an algorithm for figuring out

how to draw the line you basically try

to minimize the sum of the residents

from the points for line activists on

their squares but that doesn't matter

that much now i'm going to show you why

this doesn't always work it really only

works for you when you have a nice trend

and underfitting is when you draw a line

but you're really not capturing you know

the real shape of the data so i'm going

to point out that there are four

different sets of points that look

completely different than all have

identical lines and here they are so the

algorithm to draw the regression line

for each of these will this is the best

line it's absolutely identical in for

each of these I think you would agree

the points themselves are not similar at

all here we ought to be catching that

vertical thing here we ought to have

that curve and so on so the process of

underfitting is in too simplistic here

the line is too simplistic this one

looks ok but for the rest too simplistic

to capture meaning in the ok we're

under fitting is too simplistic

overfitting is too specific and again

I'm just going to show you example now

let's say we're not always going to draw

lines we're willing to draw curves to

capture the trend in our data so here's

an example that one would say is classic

overfitting we have these points and we

draw a curve that tries to capture every

little change in those points that's

over fitting the same data by the way

would be under fit with a line because

it's missing that there's a shape here

what would be just right would be to get

occur something like this in this

particular case doing regression here's

another example of overfitting and this

is another comic I don't know how well

you can read this in your search

expected to read all that this is using

regression to try to decide who wins

presidential elections which is a very

timely example so here at the beginning

well it's the regression says the

increment never with the ink youment

incoming something incumbent never wins

but then there's somebody who actually

violated that then they say okay well no

congressman has ever become president

and so with everything that happens the

regression takes that very specific

thing and says that's the algorithm for

deciding who's going to win and it's

kind of fun of people you know they're

fun examples like ash goes Mississippi

so goes the nation and so on okay so

that's another example of overfitting

that's not an actual graph okay next

pitfall sampling bias so so far I've

been talking about pitfalls in doing

something with the data we've collected

the data and now we're going to do

something and we make mistakes and in

doing something causation correlation

underfitting over a day now let's talk

about mistakes that can be made in the

actual collection of the data and i'm

going to use another presidential

election example i'm going to wind back

to nineteen thirty-six landon versus

Rose about how many people in the room

know this story one okay good you all

learn something you hear ok so it's 1936

these are the people who are being

running off for president and at the

time the Reader's Digest magazine was

known for very accurate predictions of

presidential races and other things in

1932 they had a one percent error in

their prediction of the presidential

election so in 1936 they surveyed a

whopping ten percent of the population

twenty-five percent percent of those

returned the survey they predicted from

that sample that Landon

in a landslide well Roosevelt won so in

fact it was a really bad prediction they

were nineteen percent off which is at

that time was the worst error in any

major opinion and the problem was that

they're sampling method was not good it

was biased there were two kinds there

was this what's known as survey sample

bias and non-response bias and the

survey sample bias is that at the time

it was the depression and they sent the

surveys to their there are people who

are subscribing to the magazine they

just home looks to send the survey and

they were very much biased towards the

wealthier segment of the population just

because of who they sent the survey to

non-response bias has to do with who

returns this serving twenty-five percent

returned the surname but again that was

skewed towards the wealthier 25% we

actually sent it in and therefore they

got a wrong a wrong result and by the

way another example is sort of

experiments that are done with your

people's mobile phones even when they're

agreeing to do it people who have

iphones are much wealthier in general

than people who have androids so when

there's ever a survey that's done on

iphones for example that will get a very

skewed by a skewed percent sample of the

population so very similar type of thing

now everybody's favorite topic is

privacy i'm going to talk about this

topic very briefly some of you might

have had a little thinking about that

when you realize your phone was being

tracked to make google maps you opt it

into that probably or didn't opt out

anyway so there have been many cases of

improper covert collection of individual

data and we all know about Snowden's so

on but there's a lot of collection going

on that you might not be aware of data

can kind of bleed legally through

surprising channel so the example i'm

going to give here is angry birds

anybody who wants to play Angry Birds I

think it sort of out of fashion now but

at the time anybody who played Angry

Birds agree to a bunch of data being

transmitted because they are signing up

for the game and most people don't read

it you'll sign up for an app it says you

know screen after screen okay fine and

one thing is that you agree to way to

play Angry Birds to transmit all the

information about the Wi-Fi networks

that your phone can see any time okay

and why do they want that information

well it's what they really are trying to

get is location information so even if

you say you don't want to be trapped on

your phone using the location using the

GPS it has been shown that by looking at

what Wi-Fi networks you can see in a

given time your position can be put

almost as accurate as a GPS position

that experiments have shown that to be

the case so beware your your private

data is being transmitted not always in

ways that you expect okay two more

pitfall examples and again I said for

timekeeping on Google twice here but

that's probably because Google is doing

a lot of the Big Data things around here

what is about Google Flu Trends and the

other is about google translate so I

don't know how many of you notice the

news around two thousand six or seven

that Google had shown that they can

predict the flumes passing across the

United States more accurately than the

Center for Disease Control and they were

doing it by looking at what people were

searching for they were searching for

flu symptoms they knew where they were

searching from so that was pretty

impressive until it failed so the third

year of the little

as they were way off they were off the

like fifty percent it was amazing it

turned out that year maybe there was

something going on with a flu shot or

maybe people too are we willing flu

trends but they weren't googling the flu

stuff because they have the flu and so

that also spawned the phrase which I

like big data humorous where people were

you know overconfident that simple

things like web search terms we're going

to tell you the truth about good stuff

another example is google translate so

actually google translate is an amazing

example of take a lot of data and do

something with it the way Google

Translate works and i'm talking about

translating from one language to another

many of you have probably used in it not

bad the way it action works is it's

learning how to translate automatically

it has been going around the web the

computers have looking at cases where

there are things in two languages

comparing them mapping them and learning

the mappings between pairs of languages

and that's how it has learned to new

translation nobody's I mean there's

people that are tuning it but nobody's

sitting there and teaching it how to

translate it's doing it from examples

the problem comes and this is a real

problem when the examples that excuse me

were actually translated by khet and it

doesn't know that and so somebody put

two things up there because they use

google translate and if there's a

mistake it just continuously reinforces

itself so that's another example of

pitfalls okay and that's negativity I do

think the discoveries outweigh the

fallacies I think that balance between

those will only improve big data is not

a fad is you know my name

since here last one minute quick

careening through what are like five or

ten different courses at Stanford in 30

seconds data management systems data

management systems have been around for

decades Oracle relational database

management systems 40 50 years huge

industry one will never go away it's

about convenient management of large

amounts of data banks use this the

Registrar uses it and then you ask

well-formed questions get me all the

dorms that sophomores are living in find

all people whose bank account is getting

too low that's what those are about

relational simple databases now there's

things called no sequel systems but

they're not opposites at all that's what

they do data mining is fundamentally

different data mining is about looking

for patterns and data so instead of

asking a specific question you say

here's all my data find some patterns

patterns things that are frequently

bought together would be a pattern

people who buy this buy that that's the

type of thing data mining does and

lastly machine learning is the process

of using a set of data to create models

about what our fins are or to predict

the future so regression that I showed

you as an example we're using one data

set and trying to generalize and that's

what people mean by machine learning

regression clustering is another machine

learning technique classification okay

so who five courses in 30 seconds and

i'm done
